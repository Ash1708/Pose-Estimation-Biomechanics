# Pose-Estimation-Biomechanics
This project uses MediaPipe Pose to estimate 3D positions of joints from a sports movement video and computes:  3D Resultant Displacements  Velocities  Joint Angles  Visualizations help to analyze biomechanical patterns, relevant for injury risk prediction and movement quality assessment in sports.
